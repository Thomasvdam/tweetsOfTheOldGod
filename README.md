# Tweets of the Old God

[C'Thun](https://twitter.com/I_Am_CThun) is a simple twitterbot that replies to specified HearthStone streamers/twitter accounts with a random maddening whisper should they mention the old Gods expansion. [It](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/C'Thun) is the first old God to have been named and also the first to have been revealed for the expansion, hence why I chose him.

## Random Whisper

Extra (bonus) script that will try to whisper a maddening thought to a random haunted user. Will actually tweet 1 every 4 times, but this is configurable. Currently lives inside a cronjob that fires every hour, which means it should average on 6 whispers a day.

### But why?

I was looking for a fun little weekend project and recently a friend created a twitterbot ([herring-3067](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/herring-3067)), which I thought looked interesting enough to fiddle around with myself.

## Plans

Should it take off I'd like to connect it to a database and allow people to tweet C'Thun new users it should haunt.

# Disclaimers

C'Thun is owned by Blizzard (although I reckon C'Thun begs to differ), and part of their IP. I just thought this was a fun way to use it. :)  
The profile picture I used for the twitter account is a piece by the talented [Richard Wright](https://www.facebook.com/richard.wright.9480111). It was featured on the "Call of C'Thun" card from the Reign of Fire WoW TCG set.
